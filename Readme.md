# Kickstarting with Excel

Overview of Project

-Purpose

Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.


- Analysis and Challenges

We used Pivot Tables and charts to analyse the data and arrive at our conclusion nd provide our conclusions to Louise..

Challenges encountered - 

1) Conversion of Unix format date to a readable format in the same cell. I added another column and input a formula.
2) Conversion of month (number) into text. I added a new column and googled how to do it.

- Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

More than 60 percent of the theater campaigns were successful whle bout 35 percent failed based on launch dates. 

- Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Campaigns with goals of less than $1000 and $1000-$5000 (highest) were the most successful

- Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

No specifc challenge encoutered

- Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1) The success rate increased and was the highest when launched in May, June (peak) and July.
2) Failed and canceled campaigns were fairly evernly spreadout throughout the year. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Higher the goal more the likelihood of failure or cancellation.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Reasons for success/failure of campaigns cannot be analysed. We dont know if failures were near misses or missed by a wide margin.Meaning of information in some columns not understood (Staff pick, Spotlight etc)

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Pie charts
Analysis of failure (how much they failed by and reasons)
